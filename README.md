## Installation

To run this project, Rust must be installed first (follow [Installation Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)). Then, run code below to `build` and `run`
```bash
$ cargo build
$ cargo run
```
Or just download the compiled program from here [guessing-game-v0.1.0-apha](https://github.com/trungit2001/guessing-game/releases#v0.1.0-alpha) and run it
```bash
$ ./guessing-game-v0.1.0-apha
```
Have fun ðŸ˜Š

## Usage

This is an easy game, you just need to guess a number and see the results from the program. If the program prompts `Too small!`, you should bet on a higher number, whereas when the program prompts `Too big!`, you should guess a smaller number. The program will prompt `You win!` when you guess the secret number correctly ðŸ¥³

This project was reimplement by me according to *Chapter 2* in [The Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
